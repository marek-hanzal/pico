# Installation

> Because this is collection of libraries, you should see **[Collection](Collection.md)** page to get an idea what's available for you.

Whole project lives in `@use-pico/` namespace on NPM and **does not** have any "root" package. Thus it depends on your needs to
pickup right tools for you.

## Packages

> The basic environment this collection expects is `Node`, there is currently no support for `Bun` or `Deno`.

    <tab title="others">
        <i>Dunno, why this tabs even exists, tell me, really you don't know how to install a package with your favourite
package manager?</i>
