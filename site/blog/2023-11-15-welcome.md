Welcome to the new blog!

I've tried some **interesting** projects to generate documentation for this collection, but all **failed** to deliver
the experience I was looking for (namely **[Nextra](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/start)** and JetBrain's new
**[Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/)** _(which was far the worst experience with docs ever)_.

So I've finally decided to switch over [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) as it get a new version, with quite a modern tooling it was
lacking before.

:::tip[The journey is over, but not ended]

It was quite a **long path** to get here, but finally I've got the **right tool** to provide you high-quality documentation.

This collection is quite big with long history, but it's lacking the _**most important thing: documentation**_.

Even for me it's sometimes _hard_ to go through all the packages and _remember_ what they do, so I'm trying to push
harder to make nice docs, even there could be nobody to read it.

I hope this mission will be successful and I'll deliver the **[best experience for you](/docs/intro)**.
