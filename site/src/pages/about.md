# About

So, you're here.

I'm glad to welcome you here, so I can tell you a little story.

## DeRivean

Ages ago, there was a project called **DeRivean**. It was a simple game engine written i C/C++, so my origins are
there. It was tough to learn and use C++ (back in 2002-2010), but I've got an idea, how to work with memory
and a lot of other interesting things.

_This was the beginning._

## Edde

Long standing name from the start of my carrier. As PHP developer (since 2011) I had to create a lot of things repeatedly.
Or there was requirement which was nice to wrap up. So **[Edde Framework](https://github.com/edde-framework/edde)** (what a flashy name) was born.

It's _**totally useless**_ today, but it gave me _foundation_ of things I want to do. **This**. Write open source software with some hope one day
it will help somebody. _Next to me._

## Leight Core

When I've found **magick** of [front-end development](https://nextjs.org/), I've got an idea of **[full-stack frontend library](https://github.com/leight-core/viv)**.

The name is strange, I've _already forgotten_, why I've chose this, but this was **the most important project** I've done so far, because
my front-end experience is built upon it.

From here I was iterating many times before the **final project** was shaped.

## Pico

**And here we are**. The name is short and simple. It's built on top of foundations laid by **Leight Core**, but it's much more polished and mature.

Also I was _bored_ to write all the times `include bla from "@leiht-core/foo"` as it was bloody long. Ok `@use-pico/foo` is not much better, but at least
I'm able to write those letters without **any pain**.

Here is the latest generation of concepts I'm using, latest ideas and basically the **top of my knowledge** at this point of time.

## What's next?

Go ahead and look into **[docs](/docs/intro)**, see the **[blog](/blog)** or you **[walk away](https://www.google.com)**. But **you're welcome**
to come back to see _**new stuff**_ I'm working on.
