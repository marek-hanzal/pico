# @use-pico/schema

This is a schema validation library (currently with quite limited, but polished set of features) heavily based on [valibot](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot), so
basically all credits goes there.

The reason this "fork" exist is more clean APi, and **polished types**, mainly around `ObjectSchema` as it wasn't working properly.
