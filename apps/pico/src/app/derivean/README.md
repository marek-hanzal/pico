# DeRivean

Here is complete source code for the strategy game; all sub-projects of @use-pico are standalone applications, so
they could be cut out and used as truly standalone app.

## Assets

Game uses AI generated assets (Flux Dev), they sometimes looks a bit strange, but I'll keep this look as it's somewhat
cute.
