# Legacy of DeRivean

This is a little project that continues on the original dream to build a game, just changed
technologies.

Here is part of repository (and application) containing functional strategy game with some interesting ideas.
In general it's a bit more an engine than a game (without configuration it does nothing).

Key concept is simple: build buildings, produce goods, discover new buildings, new goods.

## Note to source code

I've decided to experiment with low-abstraction model, thus a lot of stuff is in "strange places", but it's intentional
as the codebase is not small and project is living.

Also, it's a client-only application, literally id uses sqlite in browser, so you own all the data, there is no
need for a server at all (only static assets webserver).

## Images

Default game files are using generated images using Flux. Yaaay, free graphics designer. So, because of Flux, they cannot
be used commercially.

## Architecture

Where you see usage of kysely and direct access to SQL, in "real world" in those places may be server-actions, so the code
may look very similar.

The reason I'm using client-only code is simple invalidation, application itself is not such heavy (it mainly depends on your game).

## Some interesting features

- It's up to you to define resource, buildings, regions (lands)
- You may provide even images, so a game could look nice
- There are exclusive buildings, so when you have A, you may not be able to build B
- There are hidden production lines unless you have enough resources/built required buildings
- Simple map generator - with land drop rates, so every play (you can create more maps) is a bit more unique
- Also complex editor is available, so you can see dependency graph of you buildings (technology tree)
- Transportation is clever - buildings are looking for closest resources, accounting even for the road length
- Nice UI, I'm proud of it
- Root management and editor is quite usable
- React Flow powers the main rendering
- Client-side only, so there is no need for server
- You can create and choose fractions, so the gameplay may vary on what you build
- Nice default graphics
- Transport queue priority, construction priority
- Clever UI, so you can see, what's going on (like resource transportation, goods production and so on)
- Language independent - you create a game for your language, only base of the app is translated into supported languages

## Last note

Just keep in mind that it takes huge amount of time to develop your own game and rules. To think out building tree, prices of everything,
dependencies, this is the true game development, the application itself is only "simple shell".

So if you want to mess with the game, even default file is in Czech, I recommend to you translate and use it.

As a bonus, it contains nice default graphics :).
