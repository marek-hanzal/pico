				<h2>TODO</h2>
				<ul className={"flex flex-col gap-2"}>
					<li>
						Add notification center like inventory is full, production is full
						and so on.
					</li>
					<li>
						Upgrades: Put everything into the building, drive upgrades by
						passive "Research" points
					</li>
					<li>
						Bundle default gameplay as exported json (put into public); add
						button to root to load default/selected gameplay; idea is a few
						buttons: Settler like, Fantasy, AoE and so on.
					</li>
					<li>
						Define game ending rules: amount of resources in (individual
						resourece per required cycle), required building in a cycle. When a
						player fail, game end with the ability to reset. Each game rule may
						have an ending message to show.
					</li>
					<li>
						Define winning rules: amount of resources / building built in
						specific cycle. When rules are not met, it's like a fail.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add something like world available resources + the ability to drain
						and add resources to the world. Something like Wolrd_Inventory where
						0 means unlimited resources.
					</li>
					<li>
						World renewal resources: a list of resources with cycles and amount
						when they got renewed (world_renewal_queue).
					</li>
					<li>
						Defines seasons: list of cyclic seasons with their length; resource
						production may be bound to specific season(s).
					</li>
					<li>
						Add maintenance cost for a building: when a cycle ends, cost is
						deducted from the inventory. If there is not enough resources,
						building will be marked as offline (closed for production).
					</li>
					<li>
						Dispaly resources per season (some resources will be available only
						in specific season)
					</li>
					<li>
						Add resource probability drop: some resources may have not be
						produces (like a crop). This should be thinked out.
					</li>
